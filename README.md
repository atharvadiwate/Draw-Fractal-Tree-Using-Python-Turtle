Draw Fractal TreeðŸŒ² Using Python Turtle

A fractal is a pattern that never ends. Fractals are infinitely intricate patterns that resemble one another at all scales. They are made by repeatedly performing a straightforward technique in a never-ending feedback loop. Fractals, which are driven by recursion, are representations of chaotic dynamical systems.
Here, we are using Python Fractal to make a tree. To do this, we built new sub-branches (Left and Right) and shortened them till we reached the minimum end.

Following are the functions which is being used for drawing:

1.	turtle: Used to create turtle object.
2.	bgcolor: Used to set background color.
3.	color: Changes the color of the turtleâ€™s pen.
4.	forward: Moves the turtle forward by the specified amount.
5.	backward: Moves the turtle backward by the specified amount.
6.	left: Turns the turtle counter clockwise.
7.	right: Turns the turtle clockwise.
8.	circle: Draws a circle of the given radius.
9.	shape: Fetches the dimensions of Pandas and NumPy type objects.
10.	pensize: Sets or returns the line thickness.
11.	speed: Changes the speed of the turtle.
